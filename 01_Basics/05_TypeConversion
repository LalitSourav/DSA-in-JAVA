Type Conversion is also called 
 implicit Conversion 
 widening Conversion   
 
    automatically hue eeita


Conversion can happen when:
    a. type comatible 
        ex : int to float possible 
            int to boolean not possible

    b. destination type > source type 
        byte -> short -> int -> float -> long -> double
        byte can be convert to any type
        int can be convert to float or long
            but vice versa not possible 
                it is known as lossy convertion
                as some data is lost during convertion
                and it is known as Type Casting

    narrowing Conversion

    ex :
    float a = 25.12f;
    int b = a ;//wrong, error will occur
    int b = (int)a; // right

    // char to int is possible
     a= 97
     b= 98
